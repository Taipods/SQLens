## Description:

SeeQL aims to simplify working with sql and help better vizualize a database inside VS code. In the current iteration, users can open up a data that they are working in and run sql statments that will show the results plus number of rows and columns returned in a seprate window inside VS code. The software can also generate E/R diagrams from Create tables to show relations between tables as well as Relational Algebra for users who are starting to learning SQL and people who need relationship visualized.

## Installation:

To install SeeQL, you can go to the VS code extensions store search 'SeeQL' and click install. If encountering problems, try npm install and npm install sqlite3.

## Run the software:

Simply install from the VSCode extension store. Commands should appear in VsCode Command Line

## How to use software:
When it comes to using the software, the user can access any of the visualization features by using the vscode command line. After the user installs, it's just a matter of selecting which one and it should work. Then you select the corresponding file to that command. As long as it meets the requirements.
